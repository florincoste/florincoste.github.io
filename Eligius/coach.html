	<p>Eligius Climate Control began operating in 2010, the aim was to offer a mobile alternative for people who wanted their vehicle a/c systems maintained/repaired on site at their premises. Work undertaken included public healthcare vehicles, trucks, security vans and public service vehicles, covering and supporting the irish market.
      
      In 2011 the company was going from strength to strength and was appointed independent service centres for Carrier Sutrak and Webasto Thermo Systems. Since then the decision was made to concentrate only on the PSV market and widening the area covered to pretty much any where in the uk.With demands of customers forever changing workshop facilities are also available with fully equipped service vans with a whole host of parts to cover most eventualities when dealing with a break down out in the field.
      
      As well as dealing with bus and coach companies across <em>Ireland</em> Eligius Climate Control also works with leading manufacturers of public service vehicles such as Mercedes Benz and Higer to ensure that we are kept up to date with the latest systems and vehicles.</p>
